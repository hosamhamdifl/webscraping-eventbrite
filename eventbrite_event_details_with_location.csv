What is a Cacao Ceremony?
 This sacred Tree medicine can open your heart, facilitate healing from past wounds, and illuminate the path toward gratitude and self-discovery. Mother Cacao embodies the essence of purity within us and reveals the best version of ourselves, a version accessible to everyone. Beyond its many enchanting attributes, Indigenous elders emphasize that participating in a ceremony can harmonize our lives, thereby aligning with the greater cosmos. 
 Modern-day cacao ceremonies are not trying to emulate a cultural ritual from another time and place. Just because people long ago related to cacao in a certain way doesn‚Äôt mean that way is any better or even more suited to our present-day cultural context and needs. Instead, what cacao ceremonies today have in common with ancient cultures that worked with ceremonial cacao is a genuine desire to connect with, be guided by, and learn from cacao. The cacao ceremony is an opportunity to listen and connect. 
 The Cacao Ceremony means relating cacao with gratitude, intention, and reciprocity.¬†Within this sacred space, we will connect with our inner fire, the power that drives us to our authenticity and helps us achieve what we want.¬†¬†We will use the¬† Ora Oaxacan Spice Cacao  for this ceremony¬†to tap into the sacred heart fire within us all! 
The Medicine of Cacao
 Cacao is a teacher skilled at helping us reconnect with our hearts, tend our relationships, and walk through life purposefully and guided by a clear vision. Each month, Raven will create a different Ceremony with different Cacao blends to help you connect and heal. These Ceremonies will bring you closer to its medicine of healing and self-discovery. In this ceremony, we will incorporate the power of the drum! The shamanic drum works amazingly well to enhance the benefits of Cacao. 
Who can this Benefit?
 Embrace this ceremony as a powerful opportunity to unlock your inner fire and authenticity, and drive in the New Year! Get the mindset to tackle those new projects and make this the best year ever! There are so many benefits for you in this ceremony:

 We will open our hearts through a profound gratitude practice in this sacred ceremony. Together, we will savor Spicy Cacao, deeply connecting with the fire element. 
 Raven will then lead you on a transformative journey to connect with the deep Wisdom of this amazing plant teacher!

These memories, often tied to past traumas, shape who we are and how we navigate the world. But what if we could gently unravel those threads, allowing healing to flow through us like a gentle stream? The Forgotten Incidents: Our minds, in their wisdom, sometimes veil these incidents from our conscious awareness. They disassociate, shielding us from pain and vulnerability. Yet, within this protective cocoon lies an opportunity‚Äîan invitation to reclaim our power and rewrite our narratives. Creating Sacred Ground Before we open the circle, we prepare. The setting becomes sacred‚Äîa container for transformation. We weave safety into the fabric of our intentions, knowing that vulnerability is our greatest strength. The desert guardians and the four winds stand watch, their ancient wisdom guarding our medicine space. Journey of Liberation and Expansion Together, we embark on a sacred journey‚Äîone fueled by Psilocybin and Cacao, the ancient medicines that whisper to our souls. In this space, we shed the weight of the past, like leaves falling from a tired tree. Our rituals become bridges, connecting us to forgotten parts of ourselves. We honor the pain, acknowledge the wounds, and release them into the ether. Closing the Circle  As the journey unfolds, we dance with the elements‚Äîthe earth beneath our feet, the fire of transformation, the air that carries our intentions, and the water that cleanses. And when the time comes, we close the circle not as individuals, but as a tribe. We ground ourselves, integrating the healing energy that flows through us. Together, we emerge‚Äîstronger, wiser, and connected. Our past no longer binds us; it propels us forward. This is our medicine‚Äîa gift we share, a legacy we weave into the fabric of existence."

These art shows will showcase a variety of mediums including shibari, dance, song, poetry, prose, theatre, and mixed media pieces. We will be highlighting local + international artists, creators, and deities. All of our stories and expressions are personal - and this art show asks ""what is the through line"" ? What is it that connects all humans? Dante Alighieri describes God as ""The love that moves the sun and the other stars"" in his classic epic trilogy THE DIVINE COMDEY, composed between c. 1308 and 1320. The poem was in 3 parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso - chronicling a journey of the human experience through trials, tribulations, and eventually salvation. In our ""sequel"" to this masterpiece- we tell the journey of the artist: creation out of destruction, beauty out of suffering, redemption out of regret, forgiveness out of wrongs. In THE RED THREAD we are featuring Contemporary artist, Shibari master, Rope artist, photographer HAJIME KINOKO from Toyko, Japan. Kinoko not only considers shibari to be erotic but is also good at giving it pop interpretation and promote it to art. His unique ties incorporating nature (such as trees and rocks) as well as projects involving the innovative use of space have especially won praise. In addition to performing live rope shows, he has recently been actively releasing artwork including photographs and video, often being in charge of tying, photography, and direction. He is also well known outside of Japan, having conducted workshops in more than 20 major cities such as Paris, London, and Munich as well as in Japan. Kinoko is a rope specialist representing Japan. Mixed media art pieces will be showcased and curated by Akiko Surai as well as shibari, aerial, fire, dance, movement, and music performances with incredible local and traveling artists .

Enjoy four wines accompanied by  Italian-style light bites  as we journey through  Sicily  and  Campania .  With histories of winemaking dating back millennia, it's safe to say that these dynamic and volcanic regions know a thing or two about good vino. Facciamo un aperitivo!

After working in both retail and restaurants, all the while continuing his wine studies through various entities, he decided to take the plunge into the import and distribution side of the industry ten years ago. Now he finds himself the Portfolio Manager and Sales Director of a wonderful book of boutique, artisan wines from primarily the old world with a little smattering of those from the new. He believes wine is a reflection of the place from where it was made, a perfect semblance of terroir and the stewardship of the winemaker. A thing of great beauty in the right hands. He has been lucky enough in life to travel the vineyards throughout the world and he enjoys sharing his experiences and spreading the gospel of wine. What does  aperitivo italiano  really mean? An aperitivo (or  ap√©ritif ) is often described as being similar to the American happy hour, but in reality, it‚Äôs so much more than that. An aperitivo is a ritual, joyous and mood-lifting. It relaxes you after a day of work and prepares you for the night to come. The aperitivo has long been a staple in Italy, and in recent years, has been gaining more appreciation around the world.

About the Book: This book contributes the first commentary on the diligence chapter from Shantideva‚Äôs 8th-century classic  The Way of the Bodhisattva . While many books have explored his celebrated chapter on wisdom, diligence has been overlooked. As one of the six paramitas or perfections that are fundamental for following the bodhisattva path and helping others, diligence can profoundly impact our lives. The highly acclaimed Buddhist teacher Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche guides us through the depth and complexity of Shantideva‚Äôs teachings with his characteristic buoyant energy and clear, accessible writing. With over three decades of teaching on the subject, Dzigar Kongtrul illuminates how diligence is the inner quality that inspires us to engage with the world and, most importantly, with our own mind. In this book, Dzigar Kongtrul explores traditional teachings on diligence, such as the three kinds of laziness, the Four Immeasurables, the two strengths, rebirth, the nature of emptiness, and dependent origination. Joy is the continuous thread woven through this time-honored wisdom that will aid us throughout our lives whether in formal practice or our day-to-day interactions with an ever-changing world. With diligence, we will overcome laziness and succeed in all our meaningful endeavors. _______________ IMPORTANT TICKETING AND EVENT INFORMATION *Tickets are $5 (plus a small processing fee). *A coupon good for $5 off a copy of  Diligence ,  or a purchase on the day of the event is included with your ticket.

What is a Cacao Ceremony: Cacao when consumed intentionally in ceremony can activate a unique and subtle alchemyof inner transformation, transmuting into our outer world. A cacao ceremony is about coming together to honor and connect with this plants heart opening magic. Though this is a psychoactive plant, it is not psychedelic even still it offers euphoric and blissful moments when we drink. You will be guided into an introspective and meditative state that will allow you to connect with your own inner knowing, supporting you through different emotions and past wounds, inviting us to release and make space to receive wisdom and creative inspiration.Offerings Include: ‚óè Preparation ‚óè Cleansing ritual ‚óè A ceremonial dose of cacao sourced from the abuelas de Guatemaya ‚óè Shamanic Journey through sound led by Ixchel Arcoiris ‚óè Salt Scrub Making with intentionally chosen herbs & essential oils to take with you led by Lauryn Casazza ‚óè Grounding vegetarian soup will be provided.

It is imperative that you arrive hydrated as cacao is a detoxifying agent that can cause headaches if dehydrated. If you‚Äôd like to journey deeper with cacao, we recommend not eating anything heavy or drinking caffeine for at least a couple hours before the ceremony. Before arriving at the ceremony, you may want to think of an intention for your journey. Where can you love more? Are you ready to receive the love you deserve? Call it in! There is no wrong way to go about this, these are simply options that are available to you if you feel called.

An ancient practice where you are deeply immersed musically in a meditative experience nurturing and revitalizing mind, body and spirit.

She will be in conversation with screenwriter, playwright, and filmmaker Paloma Valenzuela. ‚ÄúSharp and ferocious, uncompromising and funny,  Lady Without Land  is a maddening and compulsively readable novel, filled to the brim with brash anecdotes and tender insights, too, about family, sex, doubt, and the search for self. Proof positive that we all have stories we read and hear, desperate to find something to drown out our sorrows, and find ourselves serving up straight shots of our own defiant music.‚Äù ‚ÄîManuel Mu√±oz Lady without Land  is a story told in fragments about se√±orita who feels lost in and lost without Los Angeles. She uses classic literature and cocktail recipes to organize and populate bits and pieces of a life: growing up as a Mexican middle-class girl in a predominantly white suburb where neighbors labeled her family the ‚Äúdirty‚Äù Mexicans; being bullied by an older sister on car rides from Los Angeles to Mexico, grappling with a father‚Äôs gambling addiction, and, later, his death; journeying on the continuous carousel of lovers the Pacific and Atlantic coasts have to offer. A shaken and stirred abecedarian, a sloppy yet put-together k√ºnstlerroman, about charting one‚Äôs life path amid cultural pressures and the grip of the ever-present past, the book can be read forwards or backwards and, with any hope, completely out of sequence so that no reader can read this novel the same way twice. Krystal Anali Vazquez  is a writer and an attorney from Los Angeles living in Brooklyn. She holds degrees from Loyola Marymount University, Georgetown, and Columbia Law School. At Georgetown, she was a fellow in the Lannan Center for Poetics and Social Practice. As part of her legal practice, she works primarily on government and internal investigations and is also a member of her firm's team that defends the legality of the DACA program.  Lady without Land , winner of the 2023 George Garrett Fiction Prize, selected by Manuel Mu√±oz, is her first novel. Moderator  Paloma Valenzuela  is a Dominican-American screenwriter, playwright, and filmmaker originally from the city of Boston. She is the founder of the production company La Palomita Productions and the writer/producer/creator of the comedic web series  The Pineapple Diaries . She is a 2019 City of Boston Fellow and an Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Neighborhood Salon Luminary. She is a lecturer and educator and has taught in the areas of screenwriting and production at Brandeis University, the Institute of Contemporary Art, and Grubstreet, to name a few. She is currently screening her latest film project a documentary film  The Seltzer Factory  which was an official selection at the 2024 Cinefest Latino Boston Film Festival.

This music is sometimes called ‚ÄúPortuguese Blues.‚Äù Ana's work captures the essence of Fado from her parents' homeland and well beyond. She performs and records music that ranges from the soulful, haunting ballads and catchy, playful songs of Fado to her own original compositions, for which she has been nominated for three international Portuguese Music Awards.

In 2011, It became a part of UNESCO World Heritage. The artist formerly known as Ramana,  Ana Vieiera  is an internationally acclaimed recording artist and a northern California native of Portuguese descent. She is also a stunning vocalist, a proficient pianist, and a gifted songwriter who has composed, performed, and recorded many of her own original Fados, which have been nominated for best Fado performance at the International Portuguese Music Awards. Ana is an internationally acclaimed recording artist and a northern California native of Portuguese descent. She also is a stunning vocalist, a proficient pianist, and a gifted songwriter who has composed, performed, and recorded many of her own original Fados. Several of these have been nominated at the largest Portuguese music awards organization: the International Portuguese Music Awards (IPMA). She has performed throughout California, San Francisco, Los Angeles, the Central Valley, SLO, Portugal, Macau, China, East Coast including New York, Hawaii, Florida the Pacific Northwest, and Mexico. Ramana just returned this summer of 2023 headlining in her parents‚Äô homeland of Madeira, Portugal at the Art‚ÄôCamacha festival. She was also featured on the RTP international network while in Madeira. Over the course of her 20-plus-year musical career and five album releases, she has opened for Mariza and headlined at several World Music festivals. Performed for the President of the Azores, Portugal at the invitation of Congressman Jim Costa. Her original composition, ‚ÄúUnido Para Amar,‚Äù was played at the awards ceremony for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy. Her music has been chosen to be featured on TAP Airlines, the flag carrier of Portugal with over 2500 nights per week to 34 countries. Her new album, Tudo De Mim will be out in early spring of 2023. Most recently her new single, Fado La La La, ranked #4 for song and her latest new video ranked 3# in North America on the Ethnocloud music platform. The critics have heaped praise upon Ana. The San Francisco Chronicle said ‚ÄúRamana is the rising star in World Music‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo one in the United States is doing more to breathe new life into Fado than Ramana Vieira, a sultry dramatic singer.‚Äù Andrew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said ‚ÄúRaman Vieira deserves a prominent place in the front rank of today‚Äôs Fado singers‚Äù Vieira was born in San Leandro, California with the beat of Portuguese rhythms coursing through her veins. Her parents had immigrated to the United States from Portugal, where her grandfather was a well-known musician and composer from Madeira Island. She grew up listening to American pop, alongside traditional Portuguese music. ‚ÄúDuring my childhood, I sang with my mother to Am√°lia Rodrigues and other fabulous fadistas that were part of her special record collection,‚Äù said Vieira. Early in life, it was apparent that Vieira possessed exceptional musical talent and went on to study at The American Conservatory Theatre. However, a spontaneous trip to Portugal shifted her professional vision and catalyzed an exploration deep into the world of fado. In Portugal, Vieira connected with her roots and found that fado ignited her spirit and set her soul aflame. She began to study intensively with local fado musicians and had the opportunity to perform. She was loved by her fans in Portugal; her authentic and individual style was refreshing and well-received. Vieira‚Äôs brilliant musicality and colorful heritage appeal to a global audience. In addition to the traditional fados, and her masterful original compositions, Vieira has now compiled a synergetic repertoire that reflects the full scope of her identity by incorporating her background of American theater, blues, and soulful classics into her sets. Through this multifaceted fusion, Vieira has finally fulfilled her fado, fate. In her own words, ‚ÄúI love being Portuguese and singing my roots. I just feel now is the time for Ramana to embrace ‚Äúall of me‚Äù‚Äìmy American and Portuguese heritage."" https://www.youtube.com/@RamanaVieira/videos https://www.facebook.com/ArtistRamanaVieira/"

She believes if a group of like minded people can gather even once a month, real change can happen. So she hopes you will attend again and make this a recurring event. She combines Intention setting, Energy Therapy Learnings, Qigong, Meditation with a full spectrum of sound healing instruments. Her assistant is her husband and soulmate, Michael, who plays some of the background sounds to help you have a full bodied, surround sound experience. About the Venue You are invited to attend a truly unique and boutique style sound healing experience held at Vitality Wellness Center in Encinitas (note outdoor signage says Energy Room). This center boasts a total of 24 Energy Enhancement Systems (EESystems) which generate multiple bio-active life-enhancing energy fields, including ‚Äúscalar waves‚Äù which can allow cell regeneration, improve immune function, provide relief from pain, detoxify the body, elevate moods, and assist in balancing right and left hemispheres of the brain to increase energy levels. Learn more about them here: http://enjoyvitalitywellness.com/ Testimonial I've had several experiences with sound bowls and as a holistic practitioner, I do include them in my sessions as well. Even though my clients and several others I know simply ""love"" them, to me they were all just ""ok"". They helped you relax and nothing spectacular. All this changed when I received a sound bath by Camille at Sikara Healing. Camille's session simply put, was divine! I found my body and mind slipping deeper into relaxation the moment she started playing. The music was seamless as if it was an orchestra of several celestial musicians playing together. She wove in different instruments and tones gracefully. Being sensitive to sound, music(trained) and energy and this session took my experience to ""sublime"". It was indeed deeply healing as I felt balanced, energized and lighter after the session. I learned later that Camille is a trained musician and plays several instruments. This talent as well as her gift as a healer combines to make her offering of sound healing a True Profound Healing session. I highly recommend Sikara Healing to anyone who would like to experience a beautiful heart opening and a mind body balancing healing session. This in-person event will be held at 162 South Rancho Santa Fe Road, #suite e 30, Encinitas, California 92024 at the Vitality Wellness Center. Don't miss out on this extraordinary experience!"

This book delves into how Cuba and one of its top exports, the Cuban cigar, are captured in cigar labels created outside the island. Through the perspective of these cigar label makers, Cuba emerges as the central character of the narrative. The book features over three hundred labels reproduced in large, beautifully detailed images. Emilio Cueto has meticulously collected and researched these labels over several decades, providing a comprehensive examination of the subject. The near-original size reproductions allow readers to appreciate the artistry of the labels, showcasing Cuba as seen through the eyes of the cigar label makers working abroad. Cuba on the Labels  follows Cueto's previous work,  La Habana tambi√©n se fuma/Havana is for Smokers  (2019). It makes a unique contribution to the bibliography of Cuban cigar label art by highlighting examples produced outside the island that feature the words ‚ÄúCuban,‚Äù ‚ÄúCubano,‚Äù or their derivatives on the labels. As Cueto states, this is ‚Äúcertainly the most thorough study ever attempted,‚Äù making it an invaluable reference book. This is the third book in Emilio Cueto‚Äôs  Inspired by Cuba!  Series. Previous volumes in the series include  Inspired by Cuba: Delivering Cuba Through the Mail: Cuba‚Äôs Presence in Non-Cuban Postage Stamps  and  A Survey of Cuba-themed Ceramics , which explore various ways in which Cuba has been celebrated through stamps from other countries and Cuban ceramics. The LibraryPress@UF is an imprint of the University of Florida Press and the University of Florida Smathers Libraries open access publishing arm.

If you've never tried it, it's like nothing you have ever experienced. Moving SLOWLY about to music for roughly 40 minutes allows one to drop into an energetic, non-judgemental, quieted mind state. Utilizing intuition, we get out of the head and into the body! Latihan kejiwaan (or simply latihan) means ""spiritual exercise"" or ""training of the spirit‚Äù. Latihan originated in Indonesia by the Subud religion and is practiced multiple times per week. In the traditional practice, men and women are kept separated and do not practice together. Latihan is practiced all over the world yet not mainstream. It is a very useful tool for creating connection and is also being taught in the Tantra and Conscious Communities. Our mission here at Journey Couture is to bring this practice to our Colorado community and steward this practice as 'mainstream' as yoga or breathwork! Journey Couture is offering a ‚ÄòNeo Latihan‚Äô where we mingle the masculine and feminine together in the space. Melissa begins with unique and guided warm-up exercises and she provides prompts throughout to help promote a deeper experience. We also provide a community where we can connect outside latihan and also integrate together. About Journey Couture  ~ we create and offer consciously curated experiences to enhance, empower and enLighten everyone's One Life! Latihan was a practice that founder, Melissa LeAira (Leffingwell), experienced in summer of 2023 at an ISTA retreat outside of Amsterdam. She was captivated at this unique meditation that allows for movement as a catalyst for a deeper inward exploration! This is a 'something new' and therefore may elicit trepidation or apprehension - and that is actually a part of the process....to allow yourself to ""step into the unknown"" and trust your intuition! Latihan is facilitated by Melissa, where she provides a safe and welcoming container by clearly defining the flow of the practice and how to maneuver about the space safely and she provides a guided warm-up and then a 'compass' for the blindfolded portion. Bring a friend and be prepared to be surprised, maybe even blown away at this incredible experience. It does not disappoint!"

A ground-breaking collection of poems exploring disability, syntax, and rhythm from a Brooklyn-based Senegalese American writer with cerebral palsy. Latif Askia Ba‚Äîan acclaimed poet with Choreic Cerebral Palsy‚Äîhonors all the things that arise from our unique choreographies. Meeting each reader with corporeal generosity, these poems create space to practice a radical reclamation of movement and the body. Together. In dialogue. In disability. At the bodega, in the examination room, on the move. ‚ÄúThis way. My body looks like a dancing tattoo.‚Äù Here, the drum of the body punctuates thought in unexpected and invigorating time signatures. These poems are percussive and syncopated, utilizing a polylingual braid of French, Spanish, Jamaican, Fulani, and Wolof, reminding the Anglophone reader: ‚ÄúI am not here to accommodate you . ‚Äù   Because these poems are not so much  for  you as they are  with  you, an accompaniment rather than an accommodation, something to be rather than something to own. With startling nuance,  The Choreic Period  encourages us to ‚Äúrelinquish the things that we have. And mark the thing that we do,‚Äù all to see and sing the vital ‚Äúthing that we be.‚Äù Latif Askia Ba  is a poet with Choreic Cerebral Palsy from Brooklyn, New York. He received his MFA in Creative Writing from Columbia University and was the Print Poetry Editor for the  Columbia Journal ‚Äôs sixty-first issue. He is the author  The Machine Code of a Bleeding Moon , and his work appears in  Poetry Magazine  and many other publications.

When you pair deep breathing with visioning, you give yourself space to believe new ideas about yourself. Showing up for the work is an energetic declaration, committing you to rewiring your electromagnetic nervous system for your body, heart, and mind coherence. This breathwork is an embodiment experience. It takes you out of your conscious, analytical mind and into your body‚Äôs electromagnetic operating system that controls your subconscious mind. Whether you have been through high stress/traumatic events or not, this modality is a powerful tool to clear your body. Everyday micro-stressors build up in our nervous system, and if we do not discharge this pressure from our body by expressing (ex-ing the pressure), then it can lead to de(pression) and su(ppression). Freedom is our birthright, and expression is the only way our bodies can complete the feedback loop of the experiences. This breathwork provides a safe container for full permission and expression so that the nervous system can work its way back to regulation and your authentic self can come forth. This experience employs circular connected breathing coupled with rhythmic music to produce a cathartic emotional release. This release may be in the form of moving, shaking, yelling, crying, or laughing and expressions of emotion (energy in motion). All of you is welcome during your session; no expression is right or wrong. Your body is simply moving it through you so that it may move out of you, allowing you to feel lighter. From that place, you will be guided to feel love and gratitude, connect with your higher purpose, and embody your ideal future self. Participants can expect to experience a powerful guided journey into neural rewiring through deep, cyclical breathing. Through this, powerful healing will take place, allowing the participant to clear away the old and invite in the new. Who is Breathe It to Believe It Breathwork for? Anyone looking for: -Ôªø Future state embodiment - Clarity in life - Personal transformation - Releasing of trauma, stress or anxiety - Nervous system regulation - Stress management Please bring comfortable clothing and a water bottle. The 1.5-2 hour journey will include: - Opening - 1 hour guided Breathwork - Sharing/Integration Circle Salman‚Äôs life and spiritual journey in this world started in California and has led him to experience and serve the medicine of plants, breath, music and dance all over the world - from the jungles of Bali to the beaches of Costa Rica and all over in between. He is a multidimensional guide who produces and runs transformational retreats and events, supports people with psychedelic journey preparation and integration, coaches on life expansion, and curates music for ecstatic dance and sound healing. His purpose in this world is to help people expand their ability to access more freedom and love for themselves. CÔªøheck out his online presence: www.instagram.com/the.shalman wÔªøww.salmanhatta.com By signing up for this session you agree to these terms: I acknowledge that Breathe It to Believe It: A Somatic Breathwork Journey is a deep and powerful process. It involves rapid and prolonged breathing that is designed to activate intense emotional responses. I have notified the practitioners of any physical injuries, mental or psychological conditions I have. I engage in this experience willingly and take full responsibility for my own physical, mental and emotional experiences during and after the session. Contraindications: Breathwork is intended as a personal growth experience and should not be looked upon as a substitute for psychotherapy.

Nunu, also known as Rap√©, is a sacred blend of finely powdered medicinal plants, herbs, and ashes, prepared by indigenous tribes of the Amazon. This powerful medicine is administered through the nose, using a special applicator known as a ‚Äúkuripe.‚Äù Our trained facilitator will guide you through the ceremony, ensuring a safe and supportive experience. Nunu is distinct from smoking or regular tobacco use. While it contains tobacco as one of its ingredients, the tobacco serves as a carrier for the healing properties of other plants and is not inhaled into the lungs like smoking. The medicine is administered through the nasal passages, ensuring no harmful inhalation. Nunu is used in a ceremonial and intentional way, unlike commercial tobacco, which is processed and addictive. Nunu blends often include herbs like menthol and eucalyptus, enhancing its clearing and invigorating properties. We do not encourage smoking in any form and promote a health-conscious environment. Nunu is a powerful plant medicine traditionally used by indigenous tribes in the Amazon basin. Made from a blend of ground plants, including tobacco and other sacred herbs, Nunu is administered through the nose, facilitating a deep connection to the spirit of the plants and the earth. This sacred medicine is used to clear mental fog, release blockages, and promote emotional and spiritual healing, often during ceremonial practices. Unlike drugs, which are typically synthetic substances designed to alter or suppress physical and mental functions, plant medicines like Nunu are holistic, working to align the body, mind, and spirit with nature's wisdom. The intent behind plant medicine is healing and awakening, rather than mere escapism or suppression of symptoms, fostering a deeper sense of clarity and insight. Nunu opens channels of introspection, cleansing the mind of unnecessary thoughts and emotional blockages. It is known to support releasing negative patterns, aid in focus, and restore balance to the body and spirit. Each ceremony is a journey of self-awareness, providing a space to reconnect with nature, awaken the senses, and invite healing on a deeper level. Legal and Safe  Nunu is a legal, non-controlled substance, making it accessible to those seeking spiritual growth and healing. It does not produce hallucinogenic effects but provides a gentle shift in consciousness, helping participants connect to their inner selves, cleanse their energy, and find peace. Our ceremonies are conducted in a safe and supportive environment, with guidance from a trained facilitator. Participants with any health concerns are encouraged to consult their doctor before attending. By signing up, participants acknowledge they are joining at their own discretion and waive all liability. Whether you are looking for emotional release, mental clarity, or a deeper connection to yourself, join us in this sacred space for a transformative Nunu ceremony.

This will be an evening of music from Mali and original music by both artists. Mamadou Sidibe The instrument that Sidibe plays, a 14-string kamele n‚Äôgoni, is one that he pioneered. The traditional six-string donso n‚Äôgoni is used for hunter rituals and ceremonies in the Wassoulou region where Mali, Ivory Coast, and Guinea converge. Sibide faced a good deal of resistance when he started adding strings and playing the instrument with the women who brought the incantatory Wassoulou sound to the world, particularly Coumba Sidibe (no direct relation) and Oumou Sangar√©. Eliyahu Sills As a highly acclaimed musician of multiple instruments, Eliyahu‚Äôs devotion to his craft and his profound understanding of various musical lineages have garnered him recognition and admiration worldwide. With a deep love and dedication to his art, Eliyahu has immersed himself in the study and performance of multiple musical traditions. These include folkloric and spiritual music of various Middle Eastern lineages, Indian Hindustani Ragas, and the multifaceted branches of African-American music, including Jazz, Soul, and Funk. At the forefront of his musical endeavors stands  The Qadim Ensemble , a groundbreaking project that transcends cultural boundaries to bring together the diverse musical traditions of the Middle East. With their  CD reaching #7 on Billboard‚Äôs World Music charts , The Qadim Ensemble serves as a testament to Eliyahu‚Äôs dedication to bringing people of diverse cultures together through the universal language of music. Eliyahu captivates audiences with soulful performances on instruments such as the ney flutes, Indian bansuri bamboo flute, and upright bass. His authenticity and skill resonate deeply, drawing listeners into the rich tapestry of his musical expression. In addition to his work with The Qadim Ensemble, Eliyahu shines as a solo artist captivating audiences with his soulful performances on instruments such as the ney (Persian, Turkish, and Arabic reed flutes), the Indian bansuri bamboo flute, the upright bass and the oud. Whether exploring the depths of Hindustani Ragas, delving into Middle Eastern folkloric and devotional music, or breathing new life into ancient Jewish songs, Eliyahu‚Äôs authenticity and soulful musicianship leave an indelible mark on his listeners. He performs throughout the country with his critically acclaimed band The Qadim Ensemble and as a solo artist as well as collaborating with many highly acclaimed musicians. Eliyahu continues to enchant audiences nationwide, from large concerts to intimate solo performances. Tickets are $29 in advance and $35 at the door. Children under 12 are free.

What is a Sound Bath? Sound baths are a symphony of instruments that activate all your senses. For centuries music has been used as a form of meditation and experiencing altered states of consciousness. The vibration and rhythm of the instruments work directly with our nervous systems and begins a process of relaxation and restoration. What is Reiki? The word ‚ÄúReiki‚Äù comes from the Japanese words ‚Äúrei‚Äù (universal) and ‚Äúki‚Äù (life energy). Reiki is a type of energy healing. Energy healing targets the energy fields around the body. Energy can stagnate in the body where there has been physical injury, emotional pain, and unresolved trauma. Reiki aims to help the flow of energy and remove blocks in a similar way to acupuncture or acupressure. Improving the flow of energy around the body can enable relaxation, reduce pain, speed healing, and reduce other symptoms of illness Facilitator(s): Vanessa Lewandowski, Kelsey Bair, Matthew Embrey, and James Cole Questions: Please send us an email to  promotealtruism@gmail.com"

My health healing journey began after a long time of suffering from anxiety, and stress leading to disease I knew it was a pattern I wanted to break and change. I had to slow down, exercise, and eat healthier. Once I slowed down I was able to have more focus and clarity.  I began my healing journey by changing my diet, walking and yin yoga.  I love and still use the elements of yin yoga by relaxing the muscles, and getting deep into the connective tissues. Breathing to relax and  listen to body where I am stuck, relaxing even deeper. I was introduced to chakras at this time which added a new dimension to my practice.  Chakras introduced me to my energy body. Focusing on these areas opened up overcoming emotions and feelings while connecting me more spiritually. I healed myself in so many ways and began a new journey of self healing and more spiritual growth.  I continued to learn more, studying yoga, reiki, tantra, yoga nidra, hypnosis and more‚Ä¶ I realized the deeper I go the more balanced and bliss I become.  As I guide, I combine new modalities with elements I love from the past such as erotic dance or gymnastics in my group and private sessions.  I love connecting, and guiding others to heal themselves.  Namaste with love, Ronna ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Classes are for all levels.

My health healing journey began after a long time of suffering from anxiety, and stress leading to disease I knew it was a pattern I wanted to break and change. I had to slow down, exercise, and eat healthier. Once I slowed down I was able to have more focus and clarity.  I began my healing journey by changing my diet, walking and yin yoga.  I love and still use the elements of yin yoga by relaxing the muscles, and getting deep into the connective tissues. Breathing to relax and  listen to body where I am stuck, relaxing even deeper. I was introduced to chakras at this time which added a new dimension to my practice.  Chakras introduced me to my energy body. Focusing on these areas opened up overcoming emotions and feelings while connecting me more spiritually. I healed myself in so many ways and began a new journey of self healing and more spiritual growth.  I continued to learn more, studying yoga, reiki, tantra, yoga nidra, hypnosis and more‚Ä¶ I realized the deeper I go the more balanced and bliss I become.  As I guide, I combine new modalities with elements I love from the past such as erotic dance or gymnastics in my group and private sessions.  I love connecting, and guiding others to heal themselves.  Namaste with love, Ronna ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Classes are for all levels.

My health healing journey began after a long time of suffering from anxiety, and stress leading to disease I knew it was a pattern I wanted to break and change. I had to slow down, exercise, and eat healthier. Once I slowed down I was able to have more focus and clarity.  I began my healing journey by changing my diet, walking and yin yoga.  I love and still use the elements of yin yoga by relaxing the muscles, and getting deep into the connective tissues. Breathing to relax and  listen to body where I am stuck, relaxing even deeper. I was introduced to chakras at this time which added a new dimension to my practice.  Chakras introduced me to my energy body. Focusing on these areas opened up overcoming emotions and feelings while connecting me more spiritually. I healed myself in so many ways and began a new journey of self healing and more spiritual growth.  I continued to learn more, studying yoga, reiki, tantra, yoga nidra, hypnosis and more‚Ä¶ I realized the deeper I go the more balanced and bliss I become.  As I guide, I combine new modalities with elements I love from the past such as erotic dance or gymnastics in my group and private sessions.  I love connecting, and guiding others to heal themselves.  Namaste with love, Ronna ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Classes are for all levels.

It is processed minimally, retaining more of its natural compounds, and is often enjoyed as a warm, bitter beverage during rituals & meditations. We like to prepare with organic vegan cream, lightly spiced and naturally sweetened with maple, agave, or monk fruit. JOURNAL / CONNECT üåüWith complete VIP access to the in house art gallery, gift-shop, great room, and private living quarters, relax and feel at home in the room or patio of your choice. Enjoy journaling, eating, drinking, and sharing your experiences with new friends. The accommodations truly foster a communal atmosphere, perfect for both connecting and reflecting. BREATHWORK / HOT TUB üõÅFor the final healing session we introduce the (hot/cold therapy) ‚ÄúViking Bath‚Äù or ‚ÄúNordic Cycle.‚Äù Gather in the side yard for a preliminary breathwork exercise before alternating between our hot tub & our antique ice tubs. The concept of cold or heat exposure is the principle of hormesis. This means exposing yourself to deliberately small amounts of stress makes your body more resilient. The combination of hot tubs and ice baths show activation of brown and beige fat cells to burn calories. The Nordic cycle also increases your heart rate and constricts your blood vessels, that drain lactic acid to aid in recovery. The body then decreases cortisol and releases norepinephrine, adrenalin and endorphins which improves your mood and makes you feel awake and rejuvenated. ICE BATH ‚ùÑÔ∏èIce bath therapy has an extensive list of benefits. Not only does it reduce swelling and inflammation, it boosts your metabolism and promotes good sleep. It is incredibly helpful for the central nervous system, pain management, and vagus nerve stimulation. The vagus nerves are the main part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls your ‚Äúrest-and-digest‚Äù and ‚Äúflight, flight, fawn‚Äù conditions. ‚òÄÔ∏èTake your time sealing the practices and continue to graze, visit, and bask in the therapeutic warmth of the bubbling waters, as the immersion draws to a close. Reflect and celebrate the healing shared with community . LODGING / AD-ONS üéÅFor those looking for an extended experience, inquire about our overnight amenities in one of our private hot tub cottages. Additionally, we offer IV hydration therapy, massage therapy, cupping, tarot/oracle readings, and more, allowing you to customize and enhance your retreat. üí´Join us every Saturday with Flowing Brooks Wellness for an extraordinary healing journey at the Cliff House Lodge in Morrison, Colorado.

Ask the front desk if in doubt ;) ABOUT YOUR HOST Brooks Witherspoon, 500 RYT, Reiki II, Authentic Relating Certified, Chef ‚ÄúIn addition to my own practice, I offer various group classes in the Denver Metro Area. I typically guide my students through Viniyoga Sequences, which is yoga for the individual. I combine multiple techniques into a harmonic flow with a special twist; along with Baptiste Style Power Yoga. No two practices are ever the same!‚Äù --- My Yogic Lineage comes from T. Krishnamacharya, the essential yogic grandfather of modern yoga. He believed that yoga should be adapted to the individual, not the individual to yoga. He used this principle in teaching the leading yogis of the 20th Century who brought the practice to the West. One of these students, Pattabhi Jois, prescribed Ashtanga Vinyassa Yoga. This is a fast paced flowing series of sequenced asanas, linked with breath and sun salutations. His other student BKS Iyenger, used his training to cultivate Iyenger yoga to cure his own disease, through asana and pranayama. His methods pay special attention to skeletal and muscular alignment, in which poses are held for much longer, allowing for adjustments; along with the use of props for injuries and restorative practice. As Krishnamacharya aged, he taught his son, TKV Disikachar, Viniyoga, or yoga for the individual, focusing on the traditional teachings, the 8 limbs, and the incorporation of ritual, chanting, and more; as it best resonates to the practitioner. I was taught all of these methods, along with additional teachings of Baron Baptiste, who studied directly under Disikachar and Iyengar, at a very young age. Along with the initial 400 hours of training, I received 300 hours of advanced ashtanga & vinyasa flow level two, while studying overseas. Baptiste incorporates the traditional teachings of Ashtanga Vinyassa, Viniyoga, Meditation and Self Inquiry. Through a fast paced, potent, and structured signature series of movements that adhere to one blue print; Journey Into Power. Power Yoga is the ultimate wake up call. This practice has the power to change your life. ‚ÄúSometimes people ask me why my power yoga classes are so challenging. I‚Äôve learned that intense physical challenge allows students to see in the moment how much more effective relaxing is than struggling. It‚Äôs about bypassing your resistance. When you are at your most tired, you don‚Äôt have the energy to resist. You relax, you stop forcing, essentially because there is no other choice, and then suddenly you discover that the source of grace was there waiting for you all along.‚Äù - Baron Baptiste My teacher, Alexandria Jayne Pulpher, studied directly under Baron Baptiste and Annie Carpenter; before founding Yoga Deza Institute in Fayetteville, Arkansas. I completed my 200 hour Solar Vinyasa YTT and 200 hour Baptiste Power YTT from Yoga Deza Institute. My 300 hour YTT was recieved at Bali Yoga Ashram. I am accredited E-RYT & 500 hour YTT by Yoga Alliance. I incorporate intention setting, energy healing, guided meditation, aromatherapy, intuitive oracle readings, and much more into yoga practice. In daily life I try to adhere to all aspects of the 8 Limbs of Yoga. I continue to learn more, advance, falter, and keep trying. This practice has been here all along. Once I found it, my body, mind and soul activated an effortless flow through the river of life. It is my duty to share this gift of love with as many beings I can. ""The rhythm of the body, the melody of the mind, and the harmony of the soul creates the symphony of life."" -BKS Iyengar ‚ÄúThe journey of yoga has showered my life with harmonious magic. This practice has catalyzed health, abundance, growth, stability and creativity; among purpose and truth on my spiritual journey. It has been a profound transformative blessing to find my niche in the Yoga Community. As a student and teacher of this sacred art, I have found strengths in myself and others that I wasn't even aware of. Seeing capability and magnificent results within the body, conjunct spirit and mind; is what inspires me to continue growth and assist others in their journey of self discovery."

Cacao Ceremonies are a celebratory ritual that opens the heart through the use of cacao (ceremonial-grade cacao). It is rooted in helping re-balance our energies, open our hearts, and restore good health. Consuming Cacao with an intention helps in switching off the external noise in this chaotic and stressful world and taking an inward journey to access stuck emotions and heal the soul. It helps with the flow state of mind and soul. Consider journaling or holding space for creative expressions. Cacao is a powerful superfood that offers a boost of energy without the crash of modern stimulating beverages.   This powerful superfood, plant medicine, has many benefits and uses; some of these include: Consciousness & Spirituality Workplace Productivity Creativity and Art Athletics and Physical Training Healthy Living   Please bring in your journal and Yoga mat.

I look forward to attending another circle in the future! Michaela Fuller   The Full Moon ritual and cacao ceremony hosted by Srimanju was extremely heart warming and soul touching. I had a fantastic time connecting with such strong women in the spiritual community. Srimanju knows how to wonderfully cultivate a loving and supportive environment that makes the hard exteriors we put on for the world melt away. The sacred space and the cacao ceremony were beautiful, restorative and lovingly intentional. We gave our full attention to the beautiful Mother Cacao and meditated with Srimanju‚Äôs guidance. I felt a deep connection to Mother Gaia, Mother Cacao and to my soul throughout the whole ritual. It was so refreshing to take a moment to breathe and be in the presence of such wonderful women.

When you pair deep breathing with visioning, you give yourself space to believe new ideas about yourself. Showing up for the work is an energetic declaration, committing you to rewiring your electromagnetic nervous system for your body, heart, and mind coherence. This breathwork is an embodiment experience. It takes you out of your conscious, analytical mind and into your body‚Äôs electromagnetic operating system that controls your subconscious mind. Whether you have been through high stress/traumatic events or not, this modality is a powerful tool to clear your body. Everyday micro-stressors build up in our nervous system, and if we do not discharge this pressure from our body by expressing (ex-ing the pressure), then it can lead to de(pression) and su(ppression).¬† Freedom is our birthright, and expression is the only way our bodies can complete the feedback loop of the experiences. This breathwork provides a safe container for full permission and expression so that the nervous system can work its way back to regulation and your authentic self can come forth. This experience employs circular connected breathing coupled with rhythmic music to produce a cathartic emotional release. This release may be in the form of moving, shaking, yelling, crying, or laughing and expressions of emotion (energy in motion). All of you is welcome during your session; no expression is right or wrong. Your body is simply moving it through you so that it may move out of you, allowing you to feel lighter. From that place, you will be guided to feel love and gratitude, connect with your higher purpose, and embody your ideal future self. Participants can expect to experience a powerful guided journey into neural rewiring through deep, cyclical breathing. Through this, powerful healing will take place, allowing the participant to clear away the old and invite in the new. Who is Breathe It to Believe It Breathwork for? Anyone looking for: -Ôªø Future state embodiment - Clarity in life - Personal transformation - Releasing of trauma, stress or anxiety - Nervous system regulation - Stress management Please bring comfortable clothing and a water bottle. The 1.5-2 hour journey will include: - Opening - 1 hour guided Breathwork - Sharing/Integration Circle"

The concept of ""form"" in music encompasses not only its structural framework but also its essential function. Over the centuries, as music evolved‚Äîwhether as absolute or programmatic, rooted in sacred practices or folk inspirations, or shifting between portraying human drama and celebrating nature‚Äîcomposers from various eras, nations, and schools have continually interpreted these forms as vehicles where long-established traditions meet their unique creativity. As we continue to honor the centennials of Luciano Berio and Pierre Boulez in this concert series, we also pay tribute to Arnold Schoenberg, the revolutionary modernist who developed the twelve-tone technique. This innovation dismantled the tonal hierarchy, paving the way for new possibilities in twentieth-century contemporary music. Tonight‚Äôs program opens with Schoenberg‚Äôs final instrumental work,  Phantasy, Op. 49 for Violin with Piano Accompaniment  (1949), composed in the United States two years before his passing. The piece juxtaposes the precision of a crafted twelve-tone row with the fluid and free-flowing nature of a fantasia. The program then transitions to a much younger French composer, Pierre Boulez, who, in the same year revised his  Sonatine for Flute and Piano . This early work reveals Schoenberg‚Äôs influence while highlighting Boulez‚Äôs emerging voice as he delved into serialism. Finally, we step into the world that Italian composer Luciano Berio described as a place where ‚Äúpast, present, and future techniques coexist.‚Äù His two  Sequenzas  expand the boundaries of technical innovation and artistic expression: the first-born  Sequenza I  for flute  (1958), a work that underwent significant revisions over time, and  Sequenza VIII  for violin  (1976), a homage to Bach‚Äôs  Chaconne  from the  Partita No. 2 . The evening concludes with Berio‚Äôs  Piano Sonata  (2001), his final piano composition and a profound synthesis of his lifelong exploration of tradition and innovation. Program : Arnold Schoenberg ‚Äì  Phantasy op.47 for Violin with Piano Accompaniment  (1949) Pierre Boulez ‚Äì  Sonatine for Flute and Piano  (1946, revised in 1949) Luciano Berio ‚Äì  Sequenza VIII for Violin  (1976) Luciano Berio ‚Äì  Sequenza I for Flute  (1958) Luciano Berio ‚Äì  Piano Sonata  (2001) Jisu Choi ‚Äì violin Leo Sussman ‚Äì flute Tina Deng ‚Äì piano *Photo by John Ciampa"

All are welcome to this practice - it is a non-competitive, inclusive environment. Savasana often includes being serenaded by Jennifer‚Äôs angelic voice and her Harmonium! Rental mats available if you do not have your own. Jennifer Ekman (she/her) earned her 200hr RYT certificate in 2020 from Brett Larkin Yoga. She then earned her second 200hr RYT certificate from Haum Yoga in San Francisco in 2022 studying under Nat Kendall, Rachel Wilkins and Jeremy Falk. Certified in Vinyasa, Hatha, Accessible Yoga and Yoga for All Jenn strives to create an inclusive, non-competitive environment for all students. First finding yoga over 20 years ago as a great form of physical exercise, Jenn quickly realized that the body isn‚Äôt the only thing yoga exercises. Now with a strong meditation practice and a desire to serve her community, she has embarked on a journey to delve deeper into yoga philosophy and the tools yoga offers for use on and off the mat. She is a huge fan of using props and encourages students to meet themselves on the mat in the present moment. Jenn teaches a slow vinyasa flow with an emphasis on finding the balance between sthira and sukha (effort and ease). She believes the practice of yoga provides great support off the mat in our technology infused and fast paced world, enabling us to slow down and be present in our own mind, body and space. When Jenn is not on the mat she can be found singing musical theatre in venues all over the bay, singing jazz with her group the High Seas, playing chauffeur to her two amazing kids, biking, hiking, traveling the world or reading a good book. She is currently assisting and undergoing a mentorship with Nat Kendall, and in training to be a CASA worker."

So you're in the big city and looking for new friends. This is your sign to enjoy a night out over community, conversation, and cocktails. Whether you need a break from work life or wanting to expand your social circles, this one's for you. Our mingle kicks off at 6pm. After that, let's see where the night takes the group! Our vision is simple: We take the no gimmicks approach to networking. No need for yet another app to take up space on your phone - just four walls and a roof for people to connect :) We coordinate with you directly, human-to-human. 21+. Business casual attire prefered.  Don't do big city life alone. Cheers to a good night, a good life, and great company! About Pistil House: Pistil : the female organs of a flower. Hello! We are Anthony &  Carly - owners of Pistil House. We are locals having grown up in North Pinellas, but as most do, we fled for ‚Äúgreater horizons‚Äù to pursue steady careers and do as one does. From NYC to Houston to New Orleans to Oregon and even New Zealand in pursuit of something greater. That ‚Äòsomething greater‚Äô ended up being right here in our own backyard. We‚Äôve turned all our experiences on the line, brewing, farming, winemaking, flower processing, and event planning coupled with our love of old things into a living, breathing business. Some call us a wine bar, some call us a flower shop, but Pistil House is just a reflection of us. Let‚Äôs talk flowers . . . the blooms are our everything. They are our inspiration and they are why most of you walk through our door. We carefully curate our flower display that adorns our fireplace. We sell our wide selection of blooms and greens by the stem in a build-your-own-bouquet format so you can tell your own story. That said, we can help put something together for you and as always, we will give your stems a fresh cut and wrap so you walk away with a beautiful gift or just something for the dining room table. For dranks, we run the spectrum from our exclusively-Pacific Northwest wine program to $5 shiners, yellow bellies, and bud heavies sold out of our clawfoot tub. Also, rotating craft beers from the Tampa Bay area line our taps as well as unreal NA options from booch to palomas row out our shelves. And don‚Äôt forget our kegged cold brew and lattes for our caffeine junkies. For food, we serve light, but mighty snacks that go great alongside our libations. We also offer a badass build-your-own charcuterie and cheese program. You pick from our rotating meats and cheeses out of the fridge and we will turn it into a proper board with all the pickly, jammy, and bread things based on what we have in the larder for the week. With all of that, we really just wanted to create a place that felt like you were walking in to our home, where we could share good times, flowers, and some booze."

Nidra Lab's Yoga Nidra is a unique version of the classical ‚Äòyogic sleep‚Äô practice guided in savanna pose in order to bring the body and mind to the edge of sleep while remaining fully awake, and into a profound restorative state. Using verbal guidance to navigate the attention, you‚Äôll experience various layers of your inner terrain while in a fully conscious dream-like state, creating the fertile conditions to plant your ‚ÄúSankalpa,‚Äù the seeds for personal transformation or manifestation. Yoga Nidra and sound therapies are naturally complementing modalities. In this journey Miguel Solari and Dan Cetlin will guide you to deeper levels of consciousness through the powerful combination of Yoga Nidra, neuroacoustics, and gong singing bowl soundbath. These sonic tools naturally aid a deeper relaxation and access to profound regions of our inner terrain, and subconscious states that can facilitate our manifestation process.‚Ä®‚Ä®You may find yourself skating on the edge of the dreamworld, a place where you can reprogram yourself and manifest your heart‚Äôs deepest desires. Get ready to explore the edges of your inner world and plant your seed of manifestation. We will provide a safe space and lead attendees to go deep within and plant their intentions in a fully conscious awake dream state to manifest and dig deeper into all their dreams, wishes, and desires. Afterwards, you can expect to feel calm, rejuvenated, and confident in your work. The neuroacoustic frequencies: Over decades, brainwave entrainment research has unveiled the remarkable potential of various audio techniques to guide our brain's activity. One such technique is binaural beats, which create a harmonious dance between your brain's left and right hemispheres. Brain entrainment techniques are capable of guiding you into states of focus, relaxation, profound introspection, and deep sleep, all depending on the fundamental frequency. Currently, there are a plethora of meditative soundtracks online that claim to use these techniques to 'balance chakras' or 'purify negative energy'. Yoga Nidra facilitator Miguel Solari and New England Conservatory trained musician Dan Cetlin, explored the world of ambient music and adopted a methodology grounded in scientific literature and self-experimentation to refine the Nidra Lab approach to this practice. Their methodologies have received feedback that reported psychedelic like experiences which inspired them to continue refining this craft. Visit @nidralab for more information. Soundbaths: Sound Baths are known to promote overall health in the physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, and energetic body. Gongs have long been found in ancient temples and indigenous around the world as they are conduit for divine energy, allowing for one to tap into the universal flow. They also induce a deep meditative space, promoting inner peace and a connection to your higher self. Tuning forks offer gentle and effective healing through the power of sound frequencies. When activated a tuning fork creates a pure and constant sound that travels through the air and i to our bodies. Our soundbath this evening will include the sacred instruments listed above these will aide you into a deep relaxation and allow you to access the information you are ready to receive whilst being in the Yoga Nidra practice. Bios: Miguel Solari of Nidra Lab - @miguelsolari23 Miguel Solari is a Yoga Nidra teacher at the Center. He was born on the solstice into an esoteric yoga lineage in Lima Peru but it wasn‚Äôt until 2003 when he received his first 200hr YTT certificate at the Yoga Training Centre in Varanasi, India. He acquired a traditional Hatha Yoga foundation based on spiritual principles that set the stage for everything else. He went on to complete vipassana training, received kriyas, and completed several pilgrimages in Southern India which led him to cultivate a steady meditation practice. He entered the native Red Road ways in 2009, and committed years to various altars and elders, learned to work with plants and eventually became a fire ceremonialist. In 2019 he received his second 200hr YTT from Shivakali Yoga in Bali where he deepened his knowledge of Vinyasa, the yogic sciences, and tantric philosophies. It was here where he discovered the powerful practice of Yoga Nidra which encompassed everything he‚Äôs ever learned and applied. A new inner light is shining and he is here to share the transformative gifts of this practice with everyone. Dan Cetlin of Nidra Lab - @dan.cetlin Dan Cetlin is an astute Yoga Nidra practitioner and trained musician. He has spent an estimated 600 hours practicing and studying in preparation to guide others. He and Miguel Solari refined the Nidra Lab methodology which uses neuroacoustics to augment the practice. At the age of 3, Dan demanded his parents buy him a violin. He has been a student of music ever since. Now, two decades later, he is on a journey to channel his voice and share his music, aiming to transmit more beauty into the world, inspire others, and lovingly embrace each moment along the way. Immersed in the Contemporary Musical Arts at New England Conservatory, he explored a plethora of modalities, genres, and artists, all while honing his ear. He has seamlessly woven countless inspirations into his own personal style, cultivating a distinct voice as a violinist, performer, improviser, composer, and producer. Inspired by his musical studies, Dan has applied the same multimodal approach to all of his life. His journey has included software engineering, self-inquiry, and ever-expanding spiritual practices. In recent years, Dan has been fascinated by both Yoga Nidra and the field of brainwave entrainment. He has performed a lot of self-experimentation guided by his deep study of related scientific research.

In this class, Evan Christie will lead you on a journey through the many Amari the world has to offer. Expect traditional concoctions from around Europe as well as new formulations created by experimental distillers. While all Amari feature bitter flavors, some are sweet and decadent with only a hint of bitterness while others are aggressive and medicinal with little sugar to relieve the bite. The ingredients can vary wildly from citrus to spices to all manner of herbs. Come explore the exciting world of Amaro. You never know exactly what you are going to taste! Must be 21+ to attend."

If you're looking for a holistic yoga practice that builds strength, increases flexibility, and promotes relaxation and mindfulness, this class is perfect for you. Come and join us in a Yoga class and experience the profound benefits of this practice! Hello, I‚Äôm Chessie! Have you ever felt an indescribable urge to return home that you couldn‚Äôt quite put your finger on? An impulse or deep yearning to lean into a great sense of relief, maybe even enter a refuge of peace? Have you ever really felt at home? This lovely treasure is actually easier to find and feel than you may think. Come sink into this sweet comfort. Surrender and open yourself up to the profound acuity found in these yogic gestures‚Ä¶Come delight with us‚Ä¶. My Yoga Practice started earnestly developing in 2002. Practice informed by an emphasis in healing and deep listening, as well as interpersonal connection, rituals, voice and self empowerment. Deep reverence for the forgotten wisdom of nature and our ancestors. Practice amplified by meditation, dance, and Reiki. Yoga for Stress and Relaxation. Practice presented as lighthearted, friendly medicine, peppered in Sanskrit, and sometimes Spanish. Founded on Classical and Hatha Yoga Theory, motivated by pranayama and alignment. Let us play with the comedy and poetry of the body. Let us move through the drama of the body. My Story Physical Pain has been one of my greatest teachers, allowing for enhanced self awareness. I have utilized yoga in order to confront physical pain as it appears in the body and negotiate with it. Wrestling with the inevitability of pain has ironically brought more whimsy and light into my life. Yoga has been the remedy as well as the administration of the remedy that allows me to withstand life‚Äôs challenges. In this way, each day becomes its own unique manifestation of the Sun Salutation. Some of my other favorite Teachers include: John Perry (Oregon), Sri Tumulai Krishnamacharya, Dr. Suma Satyan and Dr. Sathya Narayanan, (Aditya Ayurvedic Ashram Hospital, India), Peter Francyk, Erin Menut (Vermont), Erin Geeseman Rabkhe (Utah), Thich Naht Hanh, Alan Watts, Allen Ginsberg, Oscar Wilde, Maya Angelou.

The active ingredient is theobromine which translates to ""Food of the Gods."" Cacao gently opens up the emotional center of our body - the heart chakra. Blue Lotus purifies your inner vision, enhances your intuition and allows a deeper connection with your spirit which is why it is so highly regarded as a healing plant. Persian Rose is a sacred spiritual plant that not only reduces stress and anxiety, but also attracts compassion; understanding and healing. All these plants have a long list of physical healing benefits, but in ceremonial space, we focus on their Spirits that brings us back to the feeling of love, oneness, and connection. Through opening the heart, it enables us to hear our true self and work through blockages, past traumas, and dissolve any pent up negative energy. It can help us align with our true and authentic selves, and give us the ability to heal the deepest callings of our heart and give ourselves permission to evoke and be receptive in life to our heart's desires. We will evoke the Spirit of the Goddess Ixcacao, set intentions into the medicine before drinking the medicine."

Immerse yourself in the vibrations of bells, chimes, didgeridoo, flute, and gongs, guiding you into deep meditation and present-moment awareness. This journey offers a unique opportunity to experience the power of sound to calm, balance, and energize the spirit. The Science of Sound Healing Sound baths are more than a spiritual experience‚Äîthey are scientifically proven to support well-being. Vibrational frequencies from instruments like gongs and chimes stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing stress hormones like cortisol and promoting deep relaxation. Studies show sound therapy can lower heart rate, blood pressure, and feelings of anxiety while enhancing focus and emotional balance. The harmonics and overtones resonate at cellular levels, aiding in physical healing and fostering a sense of inner peace and connection. Krista Cashin will enhance the evening with  Healing Touch Therapy , a gentle practice inducing deep calm and relaxation. Through light touch on the shoulders, face, and neck, with optional essential oils, Krista‚Äôs care supports your transformation. The Healing Power of Sacred Sound Sacred sound is a universal spiritual language found across cultures and traditions. It resonates deeply within all beings, offering profound healing, balance, and rejuvenation. This sound journey combines gongs and other healing instruments to create a vibrational experience rooted in Buddhist teachings and enhanced by bio-energetics and quantum science. Participants are bathed in rhythms, harmonics, and tonalities that promote emotional balance, cellular renewal, and spiritual awakening. Event Details: Location:  The Kiva Time:  Please arrive by 6:15 PM. Event begins at 6:30 PM (No late admittance to honor the sanctity of the space.) What to Bring:  Comfortable clothing, an extra mat, pillow or blanket, and anything to support your comfort during the journey. We will provide one yoga mat, blanket and bolster for each participant. You may want to bring extra for your own comfort level.  Step into the sacred, embrace the present, and let sound guide your healing. Late entrance to this event is not admitted.

Mel Rice opened STUDIO CERAMICA in 2016 with her blood, sweat, smiles, and tears. Mel trained and worked in ceramics at San Francisco City College - Fort Mason Campus for over 8 years. Her studio is a child of The Mason Pottery Campus. This studio is run with the same foundation Mel was given at SF City College. STUDIO CERAMICA is located in the heart of SF's ""Little Russia"" on Geary Boulevard between 25th Ave. & 26th Ave. Learn the craft of making functional pottery pieces for the home. We offer Pottery Throwing Classes & Basic Hand-Building Courses given by Mel, Vincent, Tiffany, and Jay. Learn how to throw clay on a pottery wheel just like Patrick Swayze & Demi Moore in the movie Ghost! Join a great community of creative people in one of our packages made for beginners or intermediate throwers. Each student will receive 20 pounds of clay, food-safe glazes and slips, and all firings are included. Mel does not put a limit on how much a student can make in these classes, so the sky's the limit on making pots. Everyone will be given one extra class a week to come in and practice and receive guidance from the community. Students can purchase more clay at the studio from our selection of 12 different clay bodies. All of our glazes, slips, and engobes used are made the old school way from scratch in our chemical lab set up in the downstairs of the studio. We have a full clay recycling system in place at STUDIO CERAMICA and we pug and recycle all our clay. It is madness, but we do it! More experienced potters can flow at their own pace and Mel can help any student beginner, intermediate, or advanced by hopping on other classes happening at the studio. Mel, Jay, and Vincent will be giving the classes together. Each instructor has a unique style and passion for clay and spreading knowledge. Students can flow at their own pace. These classes are great for beginners or pros. Instructors will be able to help any thrower at any level. Even those who have never touched clay. All are welcome.

Week 2:  Getting started on the wheel with centering and pulling walls and becoming familiar with the ""throwing formula"". Week 3:  Trim, trim, trim those clunky pieces to discover hidden delicate cups inside those heavy pieces. Week 4:  Glaze, Glaze, Glaze....it is like dipping fruit in different chocolate flavors but it's pottery!

Tantra is an authentic spiritual path, which can take You to enlightenment or your highest state of awareness. Tantra allows us to find balance in opposites. It is the merging of masculine and feminine, Ida and Pingala, light and dark, the Fire and the water, and both fierce and graceful aspects of nature. Tantra supports the liberation of the mind and expansion of consciousness. It allows us remove the divisions that keep us from our full magnificence. Tantra is a natural approach towards experiencing life and finding union in communication with others and self, expressing emotions, inner spirituality and our own psychology, Enjoyment of our sexuality, increasing psychic ability and self-healing our trauma and relationships, and of course material success. It includes sacred art (Yantra), music (Mantra or Japa), movement (yoga or mudra), advanced breathing (pranayama), and so much more. This sacred practice is huge in scope. There‚Äôs much confusion to those first learning Tantra due to its rich history of mysticism and ritual. When you research modern Tantra speaking or hearing about tantra, people automatically relate it to only sexuality, but that is one part - the ancients believed to make love as if it was an offering to the divine, a deep commune, a meditation - union thru tantra becomes an invitation to experience the self thru the other. In our Saturday morning workshops we will go step by step over each concept of Tantra to help you embody these ancient practices into your life, and this evolved tantric lifestyle will not only teach You how to become a person truly connect to the being, a great lover, but will also give You an opportunity to live in a more conscious, healthy and whole lifestyle. We teach Tantra according to the ancient tradition, where all the important teachings have been maintained. If You feel that Tantra is something that interests You, then it might be the path for You.

What is a sound bath? The basis of all sound healing is creating consistent, stable vibrations to overcome chaotic vibrations physically, mentally, and emotionally. All sounds during a sound bath contribute to greater homeostasis, supporting you in feeling ""in tune"" and encouraging you to enter a parasympathetic or ""rest & digest"" state of being. About Ella & Svana Sound Healing Ella, founder of Svana Sound Healing, became a certified Sound Healing Practitioner in 2021 through the Globe Institute. Based in Music City for eight years, she believes in the innate self-healing abilities within everyone and has hosted women's events and one-on-one sound sessions since 2022.

We believe coffee, much like wine, has a rich complexity that can be appreciated beyond its basic function as a morning beverage. Just like wine, coffee has distinct flavor notes‚Äîsuch as fruity, nutty, floral, or chocolaty‚Äîthat can complement a wide range of foods and beverages.  Our approach is to guide you in experiencing coffee as a flavorful, multi-dimensional ingredient, not just as a drink. By carefully pairing different coffee varieties with food, we elevate both the coffee and the meal, creating a more harmonious and enjoyable experience. We've selected four single origins for this first pairing experience at Convoy Road Coffee Roasters: A coffee from Sumatra ‚Üí Dark chocolate blackberry truffles (rich, creamy) A coffee from Kenya ‚Üí Orange shortbread (crisp, bright) A coffee from Costa Rica ‚Üí Brown butter honey madeleines (tender, aromatic) A coffee from Nicaragua ‚Üí Apricot-almond biscotti (crunchy, nutty) All of these origins are specialty coffees, with two having sup scores over 85 (about 1-3% of the global harvest each year)"

Here‚Äôs one story: somebody is obsessed with meteorology and the impossibility of accurately predicting the only thing we really want to know‚Äîwhether it will rain tomorrow. Here‚Äôs another: somebody reminisces about a series of bad jobs, near misses, and desperate escapes that lead him to uncharted waters‚Äîliterally.

Join Good Vibes Yoga Studio Creatrix Deonna Thomas and Nutritionist April Pelkey for this transformative four week journey where we explore Ayurveda's elemental wisdom, harmonizing the body, mind, and spirit to unlock your fullest potential for the year ahead. Week 1: Discover Your Dosha Ayurveda teaches that we are each composed of three fundamental energies, or doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These energies influence the intricate dance of body, mind, and nourishment. This week, we will journey within to identify your primary dosha(s), gaining insight into your unique constitution and how it shapes your health and wellbeing. Week 2: Awakening Kapha Energy Kapha is the energy of coolness and stability, born of the earth and water elements. In the winter months, this grounding energy may feel heavy, leading to imbalances like lethargy, congestion, and weight gain. This week, we will awaken Kapha with invigorating practices, using movement and foods that stir vitality, clear stagnation, and refresh the body and mind. Week 3: Balancing Pitta‚Äôs Fire Pitta, the energy of transformation, is fueled by the elements of fire and water. When out of balance, Pitta manifests as irritability, overheating, and inflammation. This week, we will soothe and cool the fiery Pitta energy with nurturing foods and mindful movements, finding harmony between passion and calm. Week 4: Nurturing Vata‚Äôs Flow Vata, the energy of movement and balance, is governed by the elements of air and space. When Vata is out of harmony, it can lead to anxiety, fatigue, and dryness. This week, we will nourish and ground Vata through gentle, grounding movements and warming foods that bring calm, focus, and ease to our body and mind. Beginner to advanced yogis are welcome. Please inform us of any food allergies.
