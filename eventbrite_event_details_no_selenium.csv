What is a Cacao Ceremony?
 This sacred Tree medicine can open your heart, facilitate healing from past wounds, and illuminate the path toward gratitude and self-discovery. Mother Cacao embodies the essence of purity within us and reveals the best version of ourselves, a version accessible to everyone. Beyond its many enchanting attributes, Indigenous elders emphasize that participating in a ceremony can harmonize our lives, thereby aligning with the greater cosmos. 
 Modern-day cacao ceremonies are not trying to emulate a cultural ritual from another time and place. Just because people long ago related to cacao in a certain way doesn‚Äôt mean that way is any better or even more suited to our present-day cultural context and needs. Instead, what cacao ceremonies today have in common with ancient cultures that worked with ceremonial cacao is a genuine desire to connect with, be guided by, and learn from cacao. The cacao ceremony is an opportunity to listen and connect. 
 The Cacao Ceremony means relating cacao with gratitude, intention, and reciprocity.¬†Within this sacred space, we will connect with our inner fire, the power that drives us to our authenticity and helps us achieve what we want.¬†¬†We will use the¬† Ora Oaxacan Spice Cacao  for this ceremony¬†to tap into the sacred heart fire within us all! 
The Medicine of Cacao
 Cacao is a teacher skilled at helping us reconnect with our hearts, tend our relationships, and walk through life purposefully and guided by a clear vision. Each month, Raven will create a different Ceremony with different Cacao blends to help you connect and heal. These Ceremonies will bring you closer to its medicine of healing and self-discovery. In this ceremony, we will incorporate the power of the drum! The shamanic drum works amazingly well to enhance the benefits of Cacao. 
Who can this Benefit?
 Embrace this ceremony as a powerful opportunity to unlock your inner fire and authenticity, and drive in the New Year! Get the mindset to tackle those new projects and make this the best year ever! There are so many benefits for you in this ceremony:

These memories, often tied to past traumas, shape who we are and how we navigate the world. But what if we could gently unravel those threads, allowing healing to flow through us like a gentle stream? The Forgotten Incidents: Our minds, in their wisdom, sometimes veil these incidents from our conscious awareness. They disassociate, shielding us from pain and vulnerability. Yet, within this protective cocoon lies an opportunity‚Äîan invitation to reclaim our power and rewrite our narratives. Creating Sacred Ground Before we open the circle, we prepare. The setting becomes sacred‚Äîa container for transformation. We weave safety into the fabric of our intentions, knowing that vulnerability is our greatest strength. The desert guardians and the four winds stand watch, their ancient wisdom guarding our medicine space. Journey of Liberation and Expansion Together, we embark on a sacred journey‚Äîone fueled by Psilocybin and Cacao, the ancient medicines that whisper to our souls. In this space, we shed the weight of the past, like leaves falling from a tired tree. Our rituals become bridges, connecting us to forgotten parts of ourselves. We honor the pain, acknowledge the wounds, and release them into the ether. Closing the Circle  As the journey unfolds, we dance with the elements‚Äîthe earth beneath our feet, the fire of transformation, the air that carries our intentions, and the water that cleanses. And when the time comes, we close the circle not as individuals, but as a tribe. We ground ourselves, integrating the healing energy that flows through us. Together, we emerge‚Äîstronger, wiser, and connected. Our past no longer binds us; it propels us forward. This is our medicine‚Äîa gift we share, a legacy we weave into the fabric of existence."

Doors at 6pm",The Soap Factory,"The Divine Comedy II is a 3 part epic art show by Toni Brianna Guida Wendel of The Rope Collective, which chronicles an artist and human narrative told through the formula of the epic: World literature, mythology, religion, folklore. These art shows will showcase a variety of mediums including shibari, dance, song, poetry, prose, theatre, and mixed media pieces. We will be highlighting local + international artists, creators, and deities. All of our stories and expressions are personal - and this art show asks ""what is the through line"" ? What is it that connects all humans? Dante Alighieri describes God as ""The love that moves the sun and the other stars"" in his classic epic trilogy THE DIVINE COMDEY, composed between c. 1308 and 1320. The poem was in 3 parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso - chronicling a journey of the human experience through trials, tribulations, and eventually salvation. In our ""sequel"" to this masterpiece- we tell the journey of the artist: creation out of destruction, beauty out of suffering, redemption out of regret, forgiveness out of wrongs. In THE RED THREAD we are featuring Contemporary artist, Shibari master, Rope artist, photographer HAJIME KINOKO from Toyko, Japan. Kinoko not only considers shibari to be erotic but is also good at giving it pop interpretation and promote it to art. His unique ties incorporating nature (such as trees and rocks) as well as projects involving the innovative use of space have especially won praise. In addition to performing live rope shows, he has recently been actively releasing artwork including photographs and video, often being in charge of tying, photography, and direction. He is also well known outside of Japan, having conducted workshops in more than 20 major cities such as Paris, London, and Munich as well as in Japan. Kinoko is a rope specialist representing Japan. Mixed media art pieces will be showcased and curated by Akiko Surai as well as shibari, aerial, fire, dance, movement, and music performances with incredible local and traveling artists . Food truck and full bar offered of course at our beautiful venue The Soap Factory in Logan. Disclaimer: These art shows will feature conceptional and interactive performances with mature themes so please prepare yourself for an immersive experience with a range of emotion and sensation *no un-consensual touch or audience participation*.

An aperitivo (or  ap√©ritif ) is often described as being similar to the American happy hour, but in reality, it‚Äôs so much more than that. An aperitivo is a ritual, joyous and mood-lifting. It relaxes you after a day of work and prepares you for the night to come. The aperitivo has long been a staple in Italy, and in recent years, has been gaining more appreciation around the world.
